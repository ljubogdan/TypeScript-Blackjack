## Project Description

This is a simplified version of Blackjack with no options like splitting, doubling down, or surrendering. The player can only choose to "hit" (take a card) or "stand" (stop). The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.

## Game Rules

- Uses a standard 52-card deck.  
- Number cards (2-10) are worth their face value.  
- Jack, Queen, King are worth 10.  
- Ace can be worth 1 or 11, whichever benefits the player more.  
- Player starts with $100 bankroll.  
- Before each round, player places a bet.  
- Player and dealer are dealt two cards each; dealer’s second card is hidden.  
- If player gets Blackjack (Ace + 10-value card) initially, they win 3:2 payout unless dealer also has Blackjack.  
- Player chooses to "hit" or "stand".  
- Dealer reveals hidden card after player stands and must hit until reaching 17 or more.  
- Winner is the one closest to 21 without busting.  
- Tie ("push") returns player's bet.
